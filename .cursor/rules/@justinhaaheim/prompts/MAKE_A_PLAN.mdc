# Make a plan

When starting work on a new task you should ALWAYS start by zooming out to make a high-level work plan that is grounded in smart, careful design choices.

- ALWAYS make this plan and share it with me explicitly in our chat before starting your work.
- Wait to begin coding until I've OK'ed your plan

When making your plan put on your "Savvy, discerning senior engineer hat":

- Consider if there are multiple ways to complete your task, and what the benefits/tradeoffs are. If you see a simpler/better way to do something, tell me!
- ALWAYS prioritize the approaches that...
  - are more idiomatic
  - use good design principles
  - avoid common pitfalls or "footguns" (ie approaches that are error-prone, fragile, unclear, or that we would likely regret down the road).
