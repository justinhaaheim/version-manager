# Stay focused

- Focus on addressing the task Iâ€™ve given you in the smartest, most direct way possible.
- Always prioritize getting your change _working_ over fixing lint/typescript issues that arise. Return to fix the lint/ts issues at the end.
- Do not change anything that is not directly related to the task you are working on. Do not alter/remove comments or code unless it is required for your task, or are explicitly instructed to.
