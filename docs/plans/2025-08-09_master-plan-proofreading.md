## Scratchpad â€“ MASTER_PLAN.md proofreading

Purpose: Track notes while proofreading `docs/MASTER_PLAN.md` in isolation (no repo comparison).

### Quick plan

- Read end-to-end for structure/duplication
- Flag typos/grammar
- Flag internal inconsistencies (terminology, timelines, units)
- Suggest concise fixes

### High-signal findings (to report back)

- Duplicate heading and stray fragment in executive summary
- Mixed naming (Recent Meds vs recent-meds; OAuth vs auth)
- Week/phase timeline mismatches
- Schema/requirements mismatch (spreadsheet URL vs spreadsheetId)
- Minor grammar and style tweaks
- Schema consistency (unit fields)

Will provide actionable list with suggested wording in chat.
