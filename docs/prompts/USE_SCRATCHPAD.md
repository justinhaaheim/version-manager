# Use a scratchpad

- Always use a "scratchpad" markdown document to outline your work plan, track your progress, and provide yourself important notes or reminders (unless I explicitly instruct you to skip the scratchpad doc).
  - This scratchpad is for YOU, so that you can maintain a clear focus across long conversations or separate conversation threads. Keep it focused on what is helpful to YOU, add to it freely, update it regularly, and remove/fix content when needed.
  - All scratchpad markdown docs should be in `docs/plans/`
  - If this work stream already has a document in-progress I will link it explicitly.
  - Otherwise create a new doc with a filename that includes todayâ€™s date (you must run the `date` terminal command to get the current date) using this format: `YYYY-MM-DD_name-of-work-stream.md`
